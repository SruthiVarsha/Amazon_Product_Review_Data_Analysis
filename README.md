(Statista 2019) On average, the small and medium-sized businesses located in the USA sell more than 4,000 items per minute (Amazon 2019), which leads to millions of product reviews on Amazon. 
Reviews tell which products and features are trending, what's in demand, what's no longer relevant, how products and competitors are doing, and much more.
